      <p> Welcome to my page! phonetically my name is Kar-ehn. I'm originally from Mexico but I have lived in Minnesota for 15 years.  Currently, I work as a mobile associate in the cell phone industry and as a consultant in the health industry.
         One of my goals has always been to become multilingual and travel around the world to facilitate communication. Therefore, I declared my major in Translation and Interpreting through Century College in St. Paul Minnesota.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
          <p>I currently speak fluent Spanish and English and conversational German.
        I have always wanted to make a project of my own in the form of a business by building language learning and translation technology in the form of web and mobile applications. Online language applications and materials have always been my go-to tools to hone my language skills apart from traditional learning methods.</p>

         <p>Throughout the years, I have proclaimed myself a ‘student of life’ because I’m always looking for ways to reach my goals while improving my persona. To further materialize my project, I enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota college of continuing studies.</p>

       <p>Here are some fun facts about me: I enjoy to listen to music, jazz and classical to while reading and writing or just relaxing. Pop, rock and R&B are genres I sing along to and rap and I workout while listening to electronic house music and rap.</p>

        <p>My recent self-discovery is that happiness is not the nirvana in my life to attain but rather feeling at peace with myself. Why? Because I can find peace even in negatively perceived situations; one cannot find happiness in such situations. Who knows maybe feeling at peace is my personal happiness!</p>
